# git-recurse
Tool for showing repositories recursively<p/>

It works simlar to [vcs](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool), but git-recurse shows all of the branches which are equivalent to the current ones.

Requires at least c++17 to compile.

In linux compile as:
`g++ git-recurse.cpp --std=c++17 -o git-recurse`
